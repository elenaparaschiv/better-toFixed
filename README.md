An attempt to  <a href = "https://github.com/gordonmzhu/beasts/issues/7" > challange 6 </a>

My goal in this challange is to create a better version of the Number.prototype.toFixed(), which will call betterToFixed().
Its purpose is to make nubmers like 0.615, 10.235, and 1.005, which with a normal toFixed() would not be rounded corectly to
be rounded corectly in our new function.
i.e. 0.615.toFixed(2) would return "0.61"
   In betterToFixed(0.615, 2) would return corectly "0.62".
